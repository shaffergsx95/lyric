# Honeywell Lyric Custom Component (for Home Assistant)

This is an updated, working integration (December 2019), that is based on these two great libraries that unfortunately appear to be abandoned, buggy, and no longer work:

* https://github.com/bramkragten/python-lyric
* https://github.com/bramkragten/lyric

This will give support for the [Honeywell Lyric](http://yourhome.honeywell.com/en/products/thermostat/lyric-thermostat) thermostats in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
